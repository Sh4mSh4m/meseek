# meseek
Meseek is a portal to access both a bot and a japanese quizz application. This portal is my final submission to the OpenClassRooms Python application developpers programme.

## Meseek Bot
Meseek is a chatterbot fueled bot and besides casual chat, it responds to requests inquiring about places and useful (for me) reminders.

## Nadeshiko quizz
Nadeshiko is an application that allows Japanese students to be tested on Hiraganas, Katakanas, or vocabulary.

The admin part of the application allows staff to upload images of vocabulary which are then OCRized and presented for easier editing before updating the database of vocabulary that students can be tested with.

# Specifications
Both applications are set within the same Django 2.0+ server.
Javascripts handle the webclient part.
A postgresql database is used.
